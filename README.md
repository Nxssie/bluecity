* HTTPS clone URL: https://git.jetbrains.space/elrincon/bc/learning.git

## Prerequisites

You need a working environment with:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com) - You can install it from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) - You can install it from https://www.mysql.com/downloads/.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Install node.js from https://nodejs.org/es/download/. It's advisable to install the LTS version.

## General Installation instructions

There is a deep alternative version of this instructions for Ubuntu 20.04. [Project Install instructions for Ubuntu 20.04 in a local clean machine](/README.For.Linux.md).

The best option to start with this project is cloning it in your PC:

```
git clone https://github.com/tcrurav/bluecity.git
```

This project contains 2 different parts:
* Frontend
* Backend

You need a node.js working environment. The LTS is recommended: https://nodejs.org/es/

Once you have cloned your project install all dependencies.

```
cd bluecity/frontend
npm install

cd bluecity/backend
npm install
```

* For your frontend part, if you want to use the Google Login feature, you have to create a clientID by creating a new project on Google developers website.: https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in

Your Google ClientID is used in the file bluecity/frontend/src/components/my-login-with-google.js and should be inserted in the file bluecity/frontend/.env in the following manner: 

```
REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com,
```

* For your backend part:
1. You need a bluecity/backend/.env file with a key for the JWT:

```
    JWT_SECRET=V3RY#1MP0RT@NT$3CR3T#
```

2. You need a mysql server working.

3. You have to edit the file bluecity/backend/config/config.json, depending on your environment.

```
    "username": "root",
    "password": "your password",
    "database": "bluecity_development",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql",
    "operatorsAliases": 0
```

4. Create the mysql database, that in our case is "bluecity_development".

5. Do the migration creating the tables with the contents of /bluecity/migrations 

```
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

6. And populating the tables with data with the contents of /bluecity/seeders

```
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
```

Finally to start enjoying this project.

```
cd bluecity/frontend
npm start

cd bluecity/backend
npm start
```

Enjoy!!!

## Repo news

* July 9th:
    - Carlos Sánchez, Aarón Medina and Tiburcio have worked in a new function to display available parkings and its map.
    - Now the user can click on a parking to view its detailed information including a picture of the place.
* June 10th:
    - Carlos Sánchez has kept on sharing his desktop through Google Meet and Aarón and Tiburcio have worked in a new branch feature/remapping.
    - Now the ParkingsWithFreeScooters (former name was Mapping) component gets the userId from the logged on user.
    - After the online session Tiburcio has solved the crash when user signs out from Renting page. It was because the props.history was not passed on to the component.
* June 3rd:
    - Carlos Carlos Sánchez has kept on sharing his desktop through Google Meet and Aarón and Tiburcio have worked in the branch feature/mapping in order to create a working leaflet map to show all free scooter parkings available. We got it! Today it shows the leaflet map finally getting data from the Backend.
    - We have added the ER diagram from WebStorm IDE Grip into the README.md.
    - We also modified the component Renting to decide wether the logged in user has an already rented scooter or not.
    - The feature is not fully finished but we have decided to merge it to develop branch and then to master branch.
* May 27th:
    - Carlos Sánchez has kept on sharing his desktop through Google Meet and we all have worked in the branch feature/mapping in order to create a working leaflet map to show all free scooter parkings available. 
    - Today Carlos has also created the .env file of the frontend to avoid the burden of copying the Google ClientID for the Authentication any time there was a push/pull to/from the Github remote repo.
* May 13th and 20th:
    - Carlos Sánchez has shared his desktop through Google Meet and we all have worked in the branch feature/mapping in order to create a working leaflet map to show all free scooter parkings available. To achieve this goal we have worked on both the backend and frontend sides.
* May 6th:
    - Juan Thielmann has mirrored https://github.com/tcrurav/bluecity.git in https://git.jetbrains.space/elrincon/bc/learning.git
    - Texe has shared his desktop and now he has the project locally working in his computer.
    - Texe had been working on logos for the project and now he has added it to the project in the development branch locally. He hasn't uploaded it to the remote development branch yet.
* April 29th:
    - Carlos Sánchez has shared his desktop and worked on a new component to show how add a new table in the database, and how to show that data in a new component in the frontend.

* April 22nd:
    - We have been learning how to deal with git branches in this project.
    - We have then created a branch called feature/mytest to add a new component called MyTest. We had a problem at the end. The solution was just to modify the line 11 in backend/routes/user.routes.js, so that it stays: router.get("/", users.findAll);
    - In this meeting Carlos Sánchez, Néstor Cabanillas and Néstor Batista have already installed successfully Tiburcio's reference project, and were actively adding the new MyTest component. Aaron and Texe were still with the boilerplate actions such as installing MySQL. They plan to have during this week a meeting to finally install it all.
* April 15th:
    - We have been learning how to deploy the whole start project Tiburcio had been working on this last Eastern, starting cloning the project from github, and then installing all the stuff for both the frontend and backend, following the instructions in this github project. At least Carlos Sánchez could install it all successfully. Some other students were also successfull too or were near to achieve it.
